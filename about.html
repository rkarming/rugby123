			<p>The sport of rugby is believed to have originated in 1823 at the Rugby
			School of Rugby, England when William Webb Ellis took and ran with the ball.
			Although there is no solid evidence to support these origins, the
			international committee named the Rugby World Cup the &ldquo;William Webb
			Ellis Trophy.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Rugby is a team sport played with an oval ball (larger than a football),
			which can be carried, passed, or kicked. The sport is sometimes described as
			a mix between American football, which was derived from the sport of rugby,
			and soccer. However, unlike the two sports, rugby is a continuous, non-stop
			game played without timeouts or substitutions.</p>
			<p>In the U.S., the typical rugby seasons are in the spring and fall.
			Training for the spring season generally starts in late January or early
			February, with games running from early March to early or mid-June. Training
			for the fall season usually commences in early August, with games running
			from late August or early September to early November. Oftentimes, 7s
			tournaments occur during the summer season. (See
			<a href="overview.html">Game Overview</a> for more about 7s.) However,
			Rugby123 publishes its content on the Internet to make it available to users
			24/7/365, not just during the primary rugby seasons.</p>
			<p>The company's main mission is to help people understand the basics of
			rugby. Rugby123's vision is to promote positive conversation about rugby, as
			well as to increase the size of the rugby community nationwide. Some of the
			company's primary goals are to:</p>
			<ol id="aboutol">
				<li>Provide thorough information to enable people to start playing rugby
				today!</li>
				<li>Motivate people to get involved in the rugby world.</li>
				<li>Be recognized as the lead source of online information for beginning
				rugby players (aka ruggers).</li>
				<li>Maximize its reputation as a high quality, accurate information
				provider.</li>
				<li>Increase the number of subscribers across the U.S.</li>
				<li>Maintain its 24-hour response rate guarantee.</li>
				<li>Expand the number of tutorials offered.</li>
			</ol>

			were inside center and outside center.</p>
