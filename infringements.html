				<h2 class="head">Infringements</h2>
				<p>In rugby, an infringement is the breaking of a law. When an
				infringement is committed, the referee will blow the whistle and stop
				play, unless the non-offending team gains an advantage from the act.
				Depending on the severity of the infringement, play is restarted either
				with a scrum, penalty kick, or free kick (see
				<a href="gameplay.html">Gameplay</a> for more on restarting play).</p>
				<p>Here are some of the most common infringements:</p>
				<dl id="infringementsmaindl">
					<dt>Forward Throw</dt>
						<dd>A player cannot throw or pass the ball forward (i.e. toward
						the opposition's dead ball line). If the forward throw is
						unintentional, then a scrum will be awarded. However, if the
						forward throw is intentional, then a penalty kick will be
						awarded to the non-offending team.
						<em>Note:</em> it is not considered a forward throw if the ball
						hits a player or the ground and it bounces forward.</dd>
					<dt>Knock-on</dt>
						<dd>A knock-on occurs when a player loses possession of the ball
						and it goes forward, touching the ground or another player before
						the original player can catch it. If the knock-on is unintentional,
						then a scrum will be awarded. However, if the knock-on is
						intentional, then a penalty kick will be awarded to the
						non-offending team.
						<em>Note:</em> it is not considered a knock-on if a player rips
						or forcefully knocks the ball from the ball carrier's hands and
						the ball goes forward. It is also not considered a knock-on
						if a player charges down or blocks the ball immediately after it
						is kicked and the ball goes forward.</dd>
					<dt>Obstruction</dt>
						<dd>This occurs when a player intentionally moves or stands in a
						position that blocks an opponent from tackling the ball carrier.
						A penalty kick will be awarded for obstruction.</dd>
					<dt>Offside</dt>
						<dd>In rugby, the ball acts as the (constantly moving) offside
						line. Thus, in general, a player is offside if s/he is in front
						of a teammate who is carrying the ball. A player can only be
						penalized for being offside if s/he interferes with play or
						moves forward toward the ball while in an offside position. When
						a player is penalized for being offside, the non-offending team
						chooses either a penalty kick at the place of infringement or a
						scrum at the place where the offending team last played the ball.</dd>
					<dt>Not Releasing the Tackled Player</dt>
						<dd>After a tackle is made, the tackler must immediately release
						his/her opponent. Failing to release the tackled player
						results in a penalty kick.</dd>
					<dt>Not Releasing the Ball</dt>
						<dd>After a tackle is made, the tackled player must immediately
						release the ball. The tackled player must get up before playing
						the ball. Failing to release the ball results in a penalty kick.</dd>
					<dt>Incorrect Throw-In</dt>
						<dd>During a lineout and a scrum, the ball must be thrown in
						straight and without delay. An incorrect throw-in results in
						a free kick.</dd>
					<dt>Unfair Play</dt>
						<dd>Unfair play consists of the following:
							<dl class="infringementssubdl">
								<dt>Intentionally offending</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot intentionally commit infringements
								or play unfairly. This results in a penalty kick.</dd>
								<dt>Time wasting</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot intentionally waste time. This
								results in a free kick.</dd>
								<dt>Throwing into touch</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot intentionally knock, place, push, or
								throw the ball over the touchline, touch-in-goal line, or
								dead ball line. This results in a penalty kick.</dd>
							</dl>
						</dd>
					<dt>Dangerous Play and Misconduct</dt>
						<dd>If any of the following occur, the non-offending team is
						awarded a penalty kick:
							<dl class="infringementssubdl">
								<dt>Punching, kicking, or striking</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot punch, kick, or strike an opponent with
								his/her fist, hand, arm, elbow, shoulder, head, knee, or
								foot.</dd>
								<dt>Stamping or trampling</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot stamp or trample on an opponent.</dd>
								<dt>Tripping</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot trip an opponent with his/her leg or
								foot.</dd>
								<dt>Dangerous tackling</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot tackle an opponent early, late, or above
								the shoulder line. Furthermore, a player cannot tackle
								an opponent whose feet are off the ground.</dd>
								<dt>Playing an opponent without the ball</dt>
								<dd>A player who is not in possession of the ball
								cannot hold, push, or obstruct an opponent not carrying
								the ball, except in a scrum, ruck, or maul.</dd>
								<dt>Dangerous charging</dt>
								<dd>Charging includes making contact with another player
								without using the arms, or without grasping a player.
								A player cannot charge or knock down an opponent who is
								carrying the ball. Additionally, a player cannot charge
								into a ruck or maul.</dd>
								<dt>Late-charging the kicker</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot intentionally charge or obstruct an
								opponent who has just kicked the ball.</dd>
								<dt>Tackling a jumper in the air</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot tackle or tap, nor push or pull the foot
								of an opponent who is jumping for the ball.</dd>
								<dt>Lifting a player from the ground and driving or
								dropping him/her into the ground</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot lift an opponent into the air and drive
								or drop him/her into the ground such that his/her upper
								body or head come into contact with the ground.</dd>
								<dt>Dangerous play in a scrum, ruck, or maul</dt>
								<dd>A player in the front row of a scrum cannot rush against
								an opponent, intentionally lift an opponent off of his/her
								feet, or force an opponent upwards out of a scrum. A
								player cannot intentionally collapse a ruck, maul, or
								scrum. Furthermore, a player cannot charge into a ruck or
								maul without binding onto a player already involved in
								the ruck or maul.</dd>
								<dt>Retaliation</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot retaliate against an opponent.</dd>
								<dt>Misconduct</dt>
								<dd>A player cannot commit acts contrary to good sportsmanship.
								A player cannot commit any misconduct while the ball is
								out of play.</dd>
							</dl>
						</dd>

				<h3 class="head">Yellow and Red Cards</h3>
				<p>In rugby, a yellow card is issued for committing offenses such as
				obstruction, unfair play, dangerous play and misconduct, or repeated
				infringements. A player who receives a yellow card is suspended from
				the game for 10 minutes. This is commonly referred to as being sent to the
				&quot;sin bin.&quot; The player's team must play with one less player
				until the 10 minutes are up.</p>
				<p>A red card is issued for committing the same types of offenses as
				with yellow cards. Red cards are usually issued when the offense is more
				serious. Additionally, if a player receives a second yellow card during a
				game, s/he will automatically be issued a red card. A red card indicates
				that a player must be sent off and s/he can no longer participate in
				the match. The player's team must finish the game with one less player.</p>
