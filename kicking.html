				<h2 class="head">Kicking</h2>
				<p>There are various types of kicks used in rugby depending on the
				goal to be achieved and the situation. Here are some of the most common
				types:</p>
				<div class="printgroup">
				<h3 class="head">Drop Kick</h3>
					<p>The drop kick is used to kick off games and restart games after a
					team scores. It is also an option used to restart play after an
					infringement is called (see Restarting Play: Penalty Kicks/Free
					Kicks on the <a href="gameplay.html">Gameplay</a> page). Additionally,
					the drop kick can be used to score a conversion or drop goal (see
					Scoring on the <a href="gameplay.html">Gameplay</a> page).</p>
					<p>To perform a drop kick, drop the ball vertically so that one of
					its ends comes into contact with the ground. Put your weight on your
					non-kicking foot and as the ball bounces up off of the ground, bring
					your kicking foot forward to make contact with the bottom of the ball.
					Make sure to follow through your kick (i.e. do not stop your
					kick right after making contact with the ball).</p>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMlgmH3f1Q0?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<hr />
				</div>
				<div class="printgroup">
				<h3 class="head">Place Kick</h3>
					<p>The place kick is an option used to restart play after an
					infringement is called (see Restarting Play: Penalty Kicks/Free
					Kicks on the <a href="gameplay.html">Gameplay</a> page). Additionally,
					the place kick can be used to score a conversion (see Scoring on the
					<a href="gameplay.html">Gameplay</a> page).</p>
					<p>To perform a place kick, place the ball diagonally on the ground
					(or on the kicking tee) so that the top end of the ball is facing
					away from you. Measure the distance you need to run up to the ball.
					When you run up to the ball, plant your non-kicking foot slightly
					behind the ball and strike the ball with the laces on your kicking
					foot. Make sure to follow through your kick (i.e. do not stop your
					kick right after making contact with the ball).</p>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7eVgHjQb_bI?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<hr />
				</div>
				<div class="printgroup">
				<h3 class="head">Punt</h3>
					<p>The punt is an option used to restart play after an infringement
					is called (see Restarting Play: Penalty Kicks/Free Kicks on the
					<a href="gameplay.html">Gameplay</a> page). It can also be used to
					gain ground during play.</p>
					<p>To perform a punt, hold the ball vertically out in front of you
					with one end of the ball facing the sky and the other end of
					the ball facing the ground. Drop the ball and strike it with the
					laces on your kicking foot before it touches the ground. Make sure to
					follow through your kick (i.e. do not stop your kick right after
					making contact with the ball).</p>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8DG1LooeML0?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<hr />
				</div>
				<div class="printgroup">
				<h3 class="head">Quick Tap</h3>
					<p>The quick tap (aka tap and go) is an option used to restart play
					after an infringement is called (see Restarting Play: Penalty Kicks/Free
					Kicks on the <a href="gameplay.html">Gameplay</a> page). The
					quick tap is best used when the opposition appears vulnerable to an
					immediate attack. For example, in the clip below, Argentina (blue and
					white) restarts play, after a penalty, with a quick tap and catches
					the opposition off guard.</p>
					<p>To perform a quick tap, the ball must leave your hands and make
					contact with any part of your leg below the knee, except your heel.
					This type of kick is essentially like performing a mini punt to
					yourself.</p>

				<hr />
				</div>
				<div class="printgroup">
				<h3 class="head">Grubber Kick</h3>
					<p>The grubber kick is a low kick used to get the ball behind the
					opposition. For example, the grubber kick could be used in the
					following situation: a player is close to the opposition's goal line,
					but s/he is unable to easily carry the ball past his/her opponents
					or pass to his/her teammates. The player could use a grubber kick to
					roll the ball past his/her opponents and into the in-goal area.</p>
					<p>To perform a grubber kick, hold the ball vertically out in front
					of you with one end of the ball facing the sky and the other end of
					the ball facing the ground. Drop the ball onto the laces of your
					kicking foot and make contact with the end of the ball closest to you.</p>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFGJHEEBpgE?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<hr />
				</div>
				<div class="printgroup">
				<h3 class="head">Up-and-Under</h3>
					<p>The up-and-under kick is used to penetrate the opposition's
					defense to gain ground. For example, the up-and-under kick could
					be used in the following situation: a player catches a high ball
					at his/her 22 meter line, has no passing options, and is
					confronted by many opposing players who are chasing after the
					ball. With this type of kick, the ball goes high in the air,
					giving the kicking team's players time to run under the ball
					before it returns to the ground.</p>
					<p>To perform an up-and-under, hold the ball vertically out in front
					of you with one end of the ball facing the sky and the other end of
					the ball facing the ground. Putting your weight on your non-kicking
					foot, drop the ball and bring your kicking foot forward to make
					contact with the bottom of the ball. Kick the ball with the laces of
					your shoe, closer to your toes.</p>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zJa2D4lvHFw?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<hr />
				</div>
				<div class="printgroup">
				<h3 class="head">Chip and Chase</h3>
					<p>The chip and chase (aka chip kick) resembles the up-and-under.
					However, whereas the up-and-under is used to penetrate the
					opposition's defensive line, the chip and chase is a shorter kick
					used to move the ball over an opponent's head and into the empty
					space behind him/her. Remember that players cannot tackle an opponent
					unless s/he is carrying the ball.</p>
					<p>To perform a chip and chase, hold the ball vertically out in front
					of you with one end of the ball facing the sky and the other end of
					the ball facing the ground. Putting your weight on your non-kicking
					foot, drop the ball and bring your kicking foot forward to make
					contact with the bottom of the ball. Kick the ball with the laces
					of your shoe, but do not put as much force behind your kick as the
					up-and-under. Once you kick the ball, immediately run after it.
					Ideally, you will catch the ball right behind the opponent that you
					are trying to beat.</p>
