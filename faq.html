				<h3>That depends.</h3>
				<p>Rugby, played correctly, is no more dangerous than any other contact
				sport. Like with other sports, injuries are more common among players
				who are not in good physical condition. Although rugby players do
				not wear helmets or pads, several studies have shown that ruggers
				experience fewer head and neck injuries than players of other
				sports like football. Ruggers are taught proper tackling
				techniques and forms to minimize injuries. Furthermore, when tackled,
				players' bodies collide with other bodies, not with hard plastic
				helmets or other gear. With that said, it is common to have bruises
				or minor cuts after playing rugby since pads are not used.</p>

			<div class="panel">
				<h3>Rugby tradition encourages all players to &ldquo;leave it on the field.&rdquo;</h3>
				<p>In other words, regardless of what happens on the pitch during the
				match, ruggers shake hands and socialize once the game is over. The
				home team is expected to provide a post-game meal (and oftentimes,
				adult beverages for teams with players over 21) for the visiting team,
				as a sign of respect and appreciation for their travels. These
				post-game meals and entertainment are commonly referred to as socials.
				During rugby socials, players from both teams bond, discuss the game,
				sing rugby songs, and form friendships.</p>

				<h3>No, you can play rugby at any age.</h3>
				<p>There are youth and high school rugby teams, as well as club teams
				for adults. USA Rugby divides the youth and high school groups by
				grade level, not by age. For example, 1st and 2nd graders are
				permitted to play together, 3rd and 4th graders, 5th and 6th graders,
				etc.</p>

			<button class="accordion" id="q5">How much does it cost to play rugby?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<h3>That depends.</h3>
				<p>The cost to play rugby varies widely, depending on the team you
				play for, as well as the style and quality of the equipment you
				purchase. Here are some of the typical costs associated with joining
				and playing on a rugby team:</p>
					<ul id="costul">
					<li>Club Dues. Players must pay club dues, which typically
					contribute to league entry fees, referees, and field maintenance.
					However, the cost of club dues ranges greatly. Some teams may
					also include the cost of training equipment, game jerseys, team
					warm-up clothes, travel, meals served at the post-game socials,
					etc. in the club dues amount. Furthermore, dues can vary depending
					on how competitive your team is, where you are located, and if
					your team receives any additional funding. For example, club dues
					for an individual playing for a university-supported club team
					that participates in many fundraising events could be as low as
					$50/season. On the other hand, club dues for an individual playing
					for a non-university women's team could be $350 for the first
					season to cover team warm-up gear (which could be used in
					following seasons).</li>
					<li>USA Rugby Member Fee. Players participating in official
					matches must pay a fee to become a USA Rugby member (often
					referred to as getting <abbr title="Club and Individual Participation Program">CIPP'ed</abbr>).
					This gives players USA Rugby accident insurance, which covers
					damage inflicted upon people or objects during official gameplay.
					For example, if a CIPP'ed player kicks a ball into a car during
					an official game and dents it, s/he will not be liable for the
					damage. Getting CIPP'ed costs approximately $45/year.</li>
					<li>Equipment. Most teams require players to purchase their own
					equipment, which could include a mouth guard, shorts, socks, and
					rugby boots (soccer cleats are usually an acceptable alternative).
					This is approximately $120, on average.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Many places!</h3>

				stores such as at Dick's Sporting Goods. It can also be purchased
