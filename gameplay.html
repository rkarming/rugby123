			<h2 class="head">Gameplay</h2>
			<h3 class="head">Starting the Game</h3>
			<p>Before each rugby game, the referee facilitates a coin toss between the
			team captains. One team's captain tosses the coin while the other calls
			&quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; to decide which team wins the toss.
			The captain of the team that wins the toss chooses to either kick off or
			select an end of the field. If the winner chooses to kick off, then the
			opposing team gets to select an end. Likewise, if the winner chooses to
			select an end, then the opposing team must kick off.</p>
			<p>Each rugby game is started with a kick off (drop kick) from the half way
			line. Either team may gain possession of the ball, as long as it travels
			beyond the receiving team's 10 meter line.</p>
			<hr />
			<h3 class="head">Moving the Ball</h3>
			<p>In rugby, every player has the option of running with the ball,
			passing it, or kicking it. However, since the ball cannot be passed
			forward (only laterally or backward), players must either run with it or
			kick it to gain ground. In the game of rugby, play is continuous and, in
			general, time is not stopped unless a player is injured.</p>
			<h4 class="head">Running</h4>
			<p>The purpose of running the ball is to gain ground by running toward
			the opponent's goal line. Any player may run with the ball until s/he is
			tackled, steps out of bounds, or runs past the opponent's goal line. In
			rugby, the ball acts as the (constantly moving) offside line so the ball
			carrier cannot run behind his/her own teammates. In other words, unlike
			in football, blocking is not permitted.</p>
			<h4 class="head">Passing</h4>
			<p>Players pass the ball laterally or backward to teammates in order to
			change the point of attack, as well as to make tackling more difficult
			for the opposing team. Since the ball is the offside line, the ball
			carrier cannot pass the ball forward, only laterally or backward.</p>
			<h4 class="head">Kicking</h4>
			<p>Players kick the ball to advance it or to relieve their team of poor
			field position. Any player can kick the ball forward at any time during
			a game. The ball can be retrieved by either team. However, the ball is
			the offside line so the kicker's teammates can only recover the ball if
			they are behind the kicker when the ball is kicked, or if the kicker
			(or someone behind the kicker) moves past them to put them on-side.</p>
			<hr />
			<h3 class="head">Tackling</h3>
			<p>In rugby, only the ball carrier may be tackled. Players tackle the ball
			carrier if s/he is on the opposing team in order to prevent him/her from
			gaining more ground. In general, tackles are made around the legs and waist,
			but tackles should be no higher than the shoulders. Time does not stop when
			a tackle is made.</p>
			<h4 class="head">Rucks</h4>
			<p>When the ball carrier is tackled, s/he must &quot;place&quot; the ball on
			the ground and roll away from it, if possible, so that play can continue.
			One or more players from each team make physical contact over the placed ball,
			attempting to drive the opposition back far enough to gain control of the
			ball. This is called a ruck. Players can only enter a ruck from behind,
			not from the sides. Additionally, players may not pick up or otherwise
			interfere with the ball until it is cleared from the ruck (i.e. until one
			team is driven back far enough to expose the ball). Rucking correctly is
			critical in rugby because it is a key way to gain or retain possession of
			the ball.</p>
			<div class="printgroup">
			<h4 class="head">Mauls</h4>
			<p>Mauls are similar to rucks, except they are formed when the ball carrier
			is held up, not tackled to the ground. They consist of three or more players
			who are in physical contact, attempting to gain control of the ball. Like
			with rucks, players can only enter mauls from behind. A maul ends if the ball
			touches the ground or a player emerges with the ball.</p>

			<h3 class="head">Scoring</h3>
			<p>Points can be scored in the following ways:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Try (five points)</dt>
					<dd>A team can score a <dfn>try</dfn> by grounding the ball, or
					touching the ball down, in the opposing team's in-goal area.</dd>
				<dt>Penalty Try (five points)</dt>
					<dd>If a defending team's misconduct prevents the attacking team
					from scoring a try and the referee believes that a try would have
					been scored, the referee may award the attacking team with a
					<dfn>penalty try</dfn>.</dd>
				<dt>Conversion (two points)</dt>
					<dd>After a try is scored, the scoring team may then attempt a
					<dfn>conversion</dfn> by drop kicking or place kicking the ball
					over the crossbar between the opposing team's goal posts. The kick
					can be taken from anywhere on the field of play as long as it is
					parallel to the touchlines, and it is in line with the point
					where the ball was grounded for the try. Thus, conversion kicks
					are made easier when a try is scored close to the center of the
					in-goal area. (See <a href="kicking.html">Kicking</a> for more
					about drop kicks and place kicks.)</dd>
				<dt>Drop Goal (three points)</dt>
					<dd>A team can score a <dfn>drop goal</dfn> at any time during
					open play by drop kicking the ball over the crossbar between the
					opposing team's goal posts.
					(See <a href="kicking.html">Kicking</a> for more about drop
					kicks.)</dd>
				<dt>Penalty Goal (three points)</dt>
					<dd>If a team commits a deliberate infringement, or breaks the
					rules, the referee may award the team that did not commit the
					infringement with a <dfn>penalty kick</dfn>. A team can score
					with a penalty kick by punting, drop kicking, or place kicking
					the ball over the crossbar between the opposing team's goal posts.
					(See <a href="kicking.html">Kicking</a> for more about punts,
					drop kicks, and place kicks.)</dd>

			<hr />
			<h3 class="head">Restarting Play</h3>
			<p>After scoring, the game is restarted with a restart kick. The scoring team
			takes a drop kick from the half way line. Either team may gain possession of
			the ball, as long as it travels beyond the receiving team's 10 meter line.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, time only stops in rugby if the referee calls an infringement
			or if the ball goes out of bounds. In these cases, there are several methods
			to restart play.</p>
			<h4 class="head">Scrums</h4>
			<div id="scrumjpgcontainer">

			</div>
			<p>If the referee calls an infringement, play may be restarted with a scrum. This
			is where the pack of forwards binds together. More specifically, the hooker
			(#2) and two props (#1 and #3) bind together by wrapping their arms around
			each other. The hooker positions him/herself between the two props. This is
			called the front row. The two locks (#4 and #5) bind on behind the front row
			by getting down on one knee and putting their heads between the props and the
			hooker. This is called the second row. The number eight (#8) and two flankers
			(#6 and #7) bind on behind the second row. The number eight positions
			him/herself between the two flankers. This is called the back row.</p>
			<p>The two packs (one from each team) position themselves within an arm's
			length of each other. The referee then issues three commands, in the
			following order: crouch, touch, and engage. When the referee says crouch,
			the opposing two front rows crouch. When the referee says touch, each team's
			props touch the outside shoulder of the opposing team's props. Finally, when
			the referee says engage, both front lines thrust forward and bind onto the
			opposing team's front line, forming a tunnel between the two front rows.</p>
			<p>The non-offending team's scrumhalf rolls the ball down the center of the
			tunnel. Each team pushes forward until one front row player, usually the
			hooker, hooks the ball backward with his/her feet. The ball is then moved
			backward by the second and back rows. Finally, the scrumhalf (#9) retrieves
			the ball and puts it into play.</p>
			<p><em>Note: the positions diagram on the <a href="overview.html">Game Overview</a>
			page illustrates the typical positioning of a team during a scrum.</em></p>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nH5mi1H8lgs?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h4 class="head">Penalty Kicks</h4>
			<p>If the referee calls an infringement, a penalty kick may be awarded to the
			non-offending team. The offending team must back up 10 yards so that the
			non-offending team can restart play unopposed. The player who takes the
			penalty kick can choose to punt, drop kick, place kick, or quick tap the ball to
			restart play (see <a href="kicking.html">Kicking</a> for more information on
			the types of kicks).</p>
			<p>A team can score a penalty goal from a penalty kick. The player who takes
			the penalty kick can decide whether to signal to the referee that s/he
			intends to kick for goal. If s/he signals to the referee, s/he can choose to
			punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. Furthermore, the offending team's
			players must remain stationary with their hands resting by their sides until
			the kick is taken. On the other hand, if the player taking the kick does not
			signal to the referee that s/he intends to kick for goal, s/he can only score
			with a drop kick.</p>
			<p>If the non-offending team is awarded a penalty kick and they are not
			within range to score, they can kick for touch. This means kicking the ball
			up the field and out of bounds (over the touchline) in order to gain field
			advantage. This results in a lineout, with the kicking team throwing in the
			ball.</p>
			<h4 class="head">Free Kicks</h4>
			<p>If the referee calls an infringement, a free kick may be awarded to the 
			non-offending team. A free kick is taken immediately from the point at which
			the infringement occurred. The player who takes the free kick can choose to
			punt, drop kick, place kick, or quick tap the ball to restart play (see
			<a href="kicking.html">Kicking</a> for more information on the types of kicks).
			Unlike with a penalty kick, a team cannot score from a free kick.</p> 
			<h4 class="head">Lineouts</h4>
			<div id="lineoutjpgcontainer">
					<img src="images/lineout.jpg" id="lineoutjpg" alt="Image of a Lineout"
					longdesc="Image%20of%20a%20lineout"><br />

				</div>
			</div><!-- end lineout jpg container -->
			<p>If the ball goes out of bounds, play is restarted with a lineout. In a
			lineout, both teams form a line perpendicular to the touchline, one meter
			apart from one another. Players may be supported in the air by their
			teammates. A player from the non-offending team (the team that did not last
			touch the ball before it went out of bounds) throws the ball in a straight
			line, directly between the two lines of teams. Each team attempts to gain
			possession of the ball.</p>
