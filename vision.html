				<h2 class="head">Future Vision</h2>
				<h3 class="head">Accomplishments</h3>
				<p>This website was designed as a deliverable for Towson University's
				Fundamentals of Web Technologies and Development (AIT 616) class,
				instructed by Andrew Mangle, Ph.D., CISSP, CISA, PMP, CSSLP. The
				objectives of the course were as follows:</p>

				<p>Throughout the semester, students were assigned a total of five
				projects. Each project incorporated new material learned in class, with
				the overarching goal of satisfying all of the course objectives. Details
				about each project are listed below, along with the criteria required to
				score the highest grade.</p>
				<hr />
				<div class="printgroup">

				topic. The deliverables from this project served as the foundation for
				the remaining semester projects.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="printgroup">
				<h4 class="head">Project 4: JavaScript and Web Applications</h4>
				<p>The purpose of this project was for students to enhance their websites
				by adding JavaScript elements, along with some other common elements
				found in most modern websites. Students were instructed to set up a free
				Google Webmasters account, generate two sitemaps (.html and .xml), and
				create a robots.txt file. Additionally, students were to add three social
				media links (Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest) to their sites;
				create and add a custom JavaScript game; and incorporate jQuery into a
				web page. Finally, students were expected to add form validation on
				the Contact page and a custom greeting on the Home page.</p>
				</div>

					present and appropriately linked</li>
					<li>Form validation works with at least five different form elements
					(first name, email address (in the correct format), and three
					additional elements). When an error is present, CSS immediately
					shows the element's border in pink and provides valuable feedback
					to the right of the element</li>
					<li>Custom greeting (i.e. "Good [morning, afternoon, evening], NAME")
					present on the Home page that uses local storage information from the
					Contact form</li>
					<li>Custom JavaScript game works flawlessly, is related to the project
					topic, and is entertaining</li>

					on the Internet, it is modified to fit the student's website, the
					original source is cited in an HTML comment, and the script is
					explained in detail (at least five sentences) in the HTML comments</li>
					<li>Pages validate through <a href="https://validator.w3.org" onclick="return confirmLeave()">W3C Markup Validator</a></li>
					<li>Pages uploaded to the server with links provided in the Blackboard
					submission</li>

				<div class="printgroup">
				<h4 class="head">Project 5: Final Project</h4>
				<p>The purpose of this project was for students to apply knowledge gained
				throughout the course to deliver a complete client-side, web standards
				compliant website using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Students were
				instructed to create additional web pages to meet the 10 page minimum for

				<h3 class="head">Development Opportunities</h3>
				<p>Although Start Playing Rugby Today! is a fully functioning client-side
				website, additional features could be incorporated to make it even better.
				Ideally, we would like our website to be the #1 reference for people
				learning about the sport of rugby union. Here are some development
				opportunities:</p>
				<ul class="visionlists">
					<li>Add more features (e.g. keyboard controls, obstacle images of
					opponents, a background looped image of a pitch, game sounds) to the
					Try, Try, Try Again! game using JavaScript</li>
					<li>Establish social media accounts for Rugby123 and link them to this
					website via the existing social media links (currently linked to
					Towson University's social media accounts)</li>
					<li>Redesign the Home page using CSS and JavaScript to make it more
					exciting</li>
					<li>Start Playing Rugby Today! is a mobile-friendly site. However, it
					could be built into a mobile app</li>
					<li>Add an Equipment page to provide beginners with information about
					products such as rugby boots</li>
					<li>Develop the server side of the website</li>
